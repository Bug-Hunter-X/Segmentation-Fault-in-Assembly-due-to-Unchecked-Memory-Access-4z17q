# Assembly Bug: Unchecked Memory Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory without proper bounds checking. This can lead to segmentation faults or other runtime errors.

The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version with bounds checks.
